# DLC Difficulty Settings

This mod allows you to alter the difficulty of various parts of the Spirit World DLC.

## Global Settings

### Access DLC in all new games
You can turn this on or off. It is ***off*** by default.

When enabled, all save games can be created with Death and/or Sadness DLC whether or not those worlds have been defeated in the save game.
(Even if you don't use the rest of this Mod, this should be very useful to you.)

### Rabbits of Doom
You can turn this on or off. It is ***on*** by default.
This setting only applies when both Death and Sadness are applied to a new game.

When disabled, rabbits are removed from the cheap booster packs and the berry bush card.
Why? Rabbits create poop every 90 seconds (the duration of a normal moon). Poop can cause villagers to get sick due to the Death Curse.
Killing a rabbit creates 2 sadness due to the Sadness Curse. The combination can quickly become extremely deadly, especially if you end up with more than one rabbit.
This setting reduces the likelihood of having this issue if you find it too difficult. Of course, Rabbits still exist in more expensive booster packs.

## Greed World Settings

### Demands Difficulty
You can set this to Easier, Normal, or Harder. Normal is the default. 

* When Easier, demands of multiple items require one fewer item. If the number of items demanded is only 1, 1 extra day is granted to meet this demand.
* When Harder, demands of multiple items require one more item than usual. If the number of items demanded is only 1, 1 fewer day is permitted to meet this demand.

For example, an early demand from the king is to get him 5 olives in 2 days. When this setting is Easier, the demand is for only 4 olives. When Harder, the demand is for 6 olives.

You normally have 3 days to create the fancy dress. When Easier, you have 4 days to meet this demand. When Harder, you only have 2 days to meet this demand.

## Sadness World Settings

### Happiness Generation Speed
You can set this to Faster, Normal, or Slower. Normal is the default.

* When Faster, all means of creating happiness or euphoria take 75% of the normal amount of time.
* When Slower, all means of creating happiness or euphoria take 125% of the normal amount of time.

For reference, staring at a coin normally creates one happiness in 60 seconds. Easier becomes 45 seconds, Harder becomes 75 seconds.

## Death World Settings

### Villager Lifespans
You can set this to Longer, Normal, or Shorter. Normal is the default.

* Longer lifespans cause villagers to be young for 3 days, normal for 6 days, and old for 3 days, dying after 12 days.
* Normal lifespans cause villagers to be young for 2 days, normal for 4 days, and old for 2 days, dying after 8 days.
* Shorter lifespans cause villagers to be young just 1 day, normal for 4 days, and old for just 1 day, dying after 6 days.
 
### Old Villagers Can Make Babies
You can turn this on or off. It is ***on*** by default. When off, old villagers cannot be placed on houses to create new villagers.

* Access DLC in all New Games: Off
